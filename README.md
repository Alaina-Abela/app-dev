**MY FAVORITE SERIES**

***Pitch Perfect Trilogy***
> The Pitch Perfect Movies are my favorite movie series because it's fun, inspiring, and full of amaing music that I can sing along to. The storyline follows **The Barden Bellas**, an all-girl acappella group that strives to win the national championship. The protagonist, **Beca Mitchell** helps the group find their new sound that is far from the way they're used to. In the second movie, the group faces failure after failure but found their way back and competed on the world stage as they got their new-found strength as a team. In the last movie, after they all graduated from college, they reunited and performed around the world. Even though they went on separate ways to fulfill their careers, they showed that you can be happy for your friends achieving their dreams even if it means that you'll have to go on your own separate ways. I love how the movies mix comedy, music, and empowerment.
